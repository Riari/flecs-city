# flecs-city

This is a C++ sandbox project for exploring Flecs v4 and raylib (as well as other libraries that I'll inevitably add as it grows). The long term goal is to develop a basic city simulation with vehicles. It won't necessarily be a game, but will contain game-like systems and features. I'll probably also use it to implement other things that I want to explore in the context of Flecs, such as networking.

## Building
